          ## Claude Assistant Response
          
          üìù **Request:** ${request}
          
          Thank you for your request! Here's my analysis:
          
          ${
            request.includes('review') ? `
          ### Code Review Notes:
          - ‚úÖ SSL/TLS implementation for secure connections
          - ‚úÖ WebSocket handling for real-time streaming
          - ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/macOS/Linux)
          - ‚úÖ Proper error handling in critical paths
          
          ### Suggestions:
          - Consider adding rate limiting for WebSocket connections
          - Implement connection retry logic with exponential backoff
          - Add performance metrics collection
          ` : request.includes('improve') || request.includes('performance') ? `
          ### Performance Improvements:
          - Consider using WebRTC for lower latency
          - Implement adaptive bitrate based on network conditions
          - Add frame skip logic when network is slow
          - Use hardware acceleration where available
          ` : request.includes('security') ? `
          ### Security Considerations:
          - Self-signed certificates are used (acceptable for local network)
          - Consider adding authentication for production use
          - Implement rate limiting to prevent DoS
          - Add input validation for all user inputs
          ` : `
          I understand you're asking about: "${request}"
          
          This request would benefit from more specific details. Please consider:
          - What specific aspect needs attention?
          - Are there any error messages or issues?
          - What's the expected vs actual behavior?
          `
